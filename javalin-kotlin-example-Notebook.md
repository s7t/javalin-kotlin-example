# Javalin / Kotlin Example

This is a fork of a [GitHub project](https://github.com/tipsy/javalin-kotlin-example).

I'll branch this to experiment. The Notebook (in this repo) will track changes in each branch.

## gradle branch
This was just to convert the sample from Maven to Gradle. The software builds (gradle build) and runs (using IntelliJ run configuration to execute app.MainKt).
